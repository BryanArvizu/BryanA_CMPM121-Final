# CMPM121-Final - Outbreak
### About
Outbreak is my final for CMPM 121, a basic first-person shooter where the objective of the game is to make it to the saferoom at the end of the level. The player must navigate the facility to find 3 keycards, each unlocking doors to new areas, so that they may make it to the end. Along the way, the player must shoot zombies and manage their health and ammo by picking up drops placed around the level.
